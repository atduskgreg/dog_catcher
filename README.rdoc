= dog_catcher

http://github.com/atduskgreg/dog_catcher

== DESCRIPTION:

Do you run many Rails apps from many different directories? Do you get annoyed when you try to start a new one and an existing app is already occupying your port of choice? Are you sick of killing these Rails apps with 'kill -9' (after having to scare up their PID) and then having to clean up the stranded .pid files later?

If you answered 'yes' to any of these questions, you need the dog_catcher. The dog_catcher provides an interactive utility for politely shutting down mongrels from anywhere on your machine.

== FEATURES:

* Sends a TERM signal to one or all of your running mongrels.

* Displays them to you via port.

* Has a "catchy" name.

== SYNOPSIS:

Witness, an example dog_catcher session:

$ dog_catcher



== INSTALL:

sudo gem dog_catcher
